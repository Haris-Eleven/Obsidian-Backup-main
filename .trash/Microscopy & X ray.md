2. Alloy
3. Composite
4. Grain
5. Grain Boundary
6. Ceramic | Glass | Metallic Glass
7.  Crystal : Translation & Rotational Sym , awa proper diffraction patter
8. Rotational Symmetry
9. Folds of symmetry
	1. 1 Fold = Trivial 
10. 4 Types of symmetries

17. Why talk about 020 planes arent they the same as 010 planes 
18. Combining one kind wud give u another 
19. Only 5% interstitial atoms 
20. Details about grain boundary and grain 
21. X-ray diffraction 
22. **X rays generate when electrons jummps from higher orbital to lower orbital and fills the space in the lower orbital and as it is jumped energy is released int he form of X-rays**
23. **L -> K = Kalpha || M -> K = KBeta || M -> L alpha**
24. **Monochromatic radiation** *Filtering out unimportant x rays and this ability is called monochromaticity*
 $$
I = A.i.Z.v^2

$$
i = Current \quad v = voltage \quad z = atomicNumber
$$
A = Material Constant
	1. Why named X ?
