**STAR** format (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
1. Introduction
### 2. About Optum (how to say it)

**Short explanation (safe, interview-ready):**  
“Optum is the technology and services arm of UnitedHealth Group focused on healthcare improvement. Broadly it operates across three areas: care delivery & clinical services, data/analytics & technology, and pharmacy services — all aimed at improving outcomes and lowering costs.”

**If asked about the three subdivisions (what you told HR):**  
You can say: “Could you explain the three subdivisions and how they differ in day-to-day responsibilities?” — that’s a good ask (shows curiosity).

	2. i have good grasp of the basic concepts that people miss out on 
	3. quick learner and i have the ability to break down complex topics and understand them in chunks, i think what distinguishes me from others is my thought process i dont just stop at the why of things i like to go in depth and understand 
	4. weakness: i have this habit of not treating anything like a black box but instead knowing all about it and then moving forward, it sometimes becomes a hindrance
4. Inspiration: from the perspective of tech my inspiration is enginneers who build systems like operating systems and ros

15. Why should we hire you? 
16. Ask the hr a question 
	1.  **I asked could he explain the three subdivisions of Optum since I was not much clear on how they differ in functionalities**
	2.  **I asked about her work life and how she feels about her job**
	3. **Ho**
why should we hire u ? 
because i m a quick learner and i already have real life experience with a lot of technologies, I have system level understanding i dont just know things from the surface i go in their depths and understand them
