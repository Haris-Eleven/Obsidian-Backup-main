## *Look Back on Yesterday*
- I didn't study at all even after being at home and the reason being is that i felt entitled to have a day for myself
- I did other important tasks done so i felt like i did good i dont need to study now 
- Ig the thing thats wrong is thinking that having a day for myself means i dont have to study 
- I should study not because you want to but need do 

*" Doing what you need to over that what you want to is the true definition of success "*


## *Plan for Today*
- Do more than 6 hours today during all the remaining days i need to bring my average back to 6 hours
