## *Look Back on Yesterday*
- It was good since i gave up on shorts my screen time reduced by an hour and my focus has increased 
- And i felt like , like i used to feel before when i used to watch vsauce , i feel like my knowledge base is expanding 
- Interleaving is doing a pretty good job 
- Doing topics like these is allowing me to do more stuff and not get stuck on thing 


## *Plan for Today*
- Just continue on like im going 
- Don't delay important tasks if u got something important to do then do it fast else it might be too late 
*you can't go back and change the beginning, but can start where you are and change the ending*
- Keep this in mind today and do the necessary
