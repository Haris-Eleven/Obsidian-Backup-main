## *Look Back on Yesterday*
- It was perfect exactly how I want each day to be, I did cp, dev, random stuff, entertainment all packed together
- Listening to songs after many days feels great 
- Realizing it first hand experience of dopamine tolerance 
- Just hope to continue this flow for this and the coming month 


## *Plan for Today*
