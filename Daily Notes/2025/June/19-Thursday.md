## *Look Back on Yesterday*
- One good thing i found better timing to do daily note instead of night i do it just after i get up its better and more effective this way 
- Instead of getting burnout by doing cp continuously its better to do multiple things at the same time 
- And those thoughts don't come if you don't feel stuck 
- I can reward myself with an episode of my favorite show
- I wud say it was a balanced day i watched show and studied in balance 


## *Plan for Today*
- Apply for passport as it is already expired 
- Study more than i did yesterday 
- 1% better everyday
