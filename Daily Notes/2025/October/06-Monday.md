## *Thoughts*
Ya thoughts so disturbing so overwhelming so much at the same time that its hard to process them and the hardest part is to , what to process first.
I feel like its a restart or should i say a revival I'm back where I was before and this time I mustn't fail. 
Life has given me enough oppurtunities to do better and everytime i get one i feel like they are limited and as I waste each one of them I feel more and more burdened.
Why do u wanna study os , is it of any use right now to u , whats something that is urgent and extremely important, fill the eisenhover matrix and do tasks accordingly.
