## *Thoughts*
- Hi, Daily Notes Long time no see , i have to that my life in general was much better with you then it is atp.
- I dont know what stopped me from writing down my daily targets and reflecting back on yesterday 
- Now that I look back , I realize that it was guilt of not having done things the day before that stopped me from tracking and writing about it.
- Now I take a resolution to do this one thing at the very least everyday for all days to come.

## *Look Back on Yesterday*
- It wasn't a productive day awa a good day for me, I did what i didn't wanted to multiple times as well 
- It was depressing and messy and all other kinds of bad words
- I showed no self control
- I let the outside world control me instead of my inner self.


## *Plan for Today*
- Its more like a plan for remaining days not today only
- I have to solve as many questions as I possibly can both DSA and cp and one thing is that if I can't solve any ill not wait for the solution to strike up ill see hints and try again.

## *Targets*
1. [ ] 10 CP questions
2. [ ] 10 DSA questions 
3. [ ] Work on Project if U feel bored
