## *Thoughts*
- That little fire is again igniting but I'm not dependent on the fire anymore, my system is stronger than ever and I dont need any external sources to motivate me to do what I need to do.
- How come are you able to do question with complete focus when giving contest and not when upsolving it or doing dsa , what happens to your focus 
	- I think the main reason is the limit of the resources that I have during that time, and the time constraint creates a sense of urgency plus the fear of losing the rating also improves focus.
	- So how can you implement similar thing when doing upsolving or dsa ?
		- First thing is to start small with just 1 question, don't move forward unless u completely understand it , hit it from all logic sides if nothing comes up see the tutorial then move on to the next question

## *Look Back on Yesterday*
- I got my health back on track made some progress , had the realisation of how much have I wasted compared to others who have grinding relentlessly without any second thoughts 


## *Plan for Today*
- To not sit idle I'll continue doing something from the things that I need untill I reach my target to do or I'll just do nothing 
- Have this mindset of hitting quota before you are free of doing anything else
