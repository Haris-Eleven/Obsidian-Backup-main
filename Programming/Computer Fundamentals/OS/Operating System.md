# Abstractions:
Abstraction makes it possible to write a large program by dividing it into small and understandable pieces, to write such a program in a high-level language like C without thinking about assembly, to write code in assembly without thinking about logic gates, and to build a processor out of gates without thinking too much about transistors.
