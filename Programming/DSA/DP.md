# Steps to solve any dp :
1. Represent Problem in terms of index ( add extra stuff if needed )
2. Do stuff on index like trying out all *possible things at that index*
3. Returning required thing
---
* Recursion does not necessarily means top-down 
* Start from fixed point to variable point
* Simultaneous Recursion from two points
* DP can be a map as well 
# Memoisation 
- What should the recursive function give 
# Tabulation 
- What should the dp table represent 
# Space Optimisation
# Types
## On subsequence 
1. Meet in the middle
2. Knapsack 
## On Substring 
1.  LCS 
2. Variations of LCS 
## On Stocks
## On LIS
## On MCM (Partition DP)
